# COP2030
## Work done in Programming Concepts
In this repository I will be dispalying all of the work that I have completed in my programming concepts class using Python. Below I will list the names of the projects and include a brief description of what the code does.

**Decision Structures** This file displays my knowledge of decision structures using the if, elif and else statements.

**Dice** This file demonstrates my understanding of the random.randint() function.

**Grades** This file demonstrates my understanding of the def main () function, while loops, and the input() functions.

**Histogram** In this file, the code takes in a .txt file and seperates the words. Then it prints the count of each word.

**Main** This file demonstrates my understaning of the main() function.

**Miles** This file demonstrates my understaning of the main() function.

**Players** This file demonstrates my understanding of opening and closing output files while using input functions, and for loops.

**Project 1** In this file I was able to finish some pre-existing code. The code takes transactions, calculates the tax, total and subtotal, and prints a receipt. 

**Repetion Structures**  In this file I demontrate my understanding of repetition structures using loops.

**Seconds** This file demonstrates my understaning of the main() function.

**Stadium**
